Setting up Nextcloud on TrueNAS.

There are a couple files that need to be configured for nextcloud to work on TrueNAS.

Go to the Nextcloud jails shell and configure the config.php file.

# cd /usr/local/www/nextcloud/config
# edit config.php

Add the folowing to the file config.php trusted domains '192.168.2.34' and 'nextcloud.blackdiamond-tech.ca' as seprate lines.

'trusted_domains' =>
array (
  0 => 'local host',
  1 => '192.168.2.21',
  2 => '192.168.2.34',
  3 => 'nextcloud.blackdiamond-tech.ca',
),

Then add at the end of the config.php file for the default phone region.

'default_phone_region' => 'CA'



Next go to the Nextcloud jails shell and configure the php.truenas.ini file.

# cd /usr/local/etc/php
# edit php.truenas.ini
